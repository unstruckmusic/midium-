# midium-
Midi file player and maybe performance midi tool

Based on the teensy 4.1. A minimal midi file player which is visible to your computer as a mass storage device, so you can drop SMF files into it and hit play (or send midi stsrt / stop ) and the midium- will play the midi out of its many midi ports. There are 8 midi ports in and out in the kit, so that gives a lot of flexibilty and hopefully good timing.
